# MORE IS LESS?

Actually, in brutalism, more borders means more clarity.

## THE BOX MODEL

Every element is a box. Why hide it?

- **No Shadows**: Unless they are offset black boxes.
- **No Gradients**: Just solid, punchy colors.
- **No Fear**: Design like it's 1995 but with better CSS.

### SUMMARY

Don't be afraid to be loud.
