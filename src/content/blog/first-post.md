# THE RAW TRUTH

Brutalism in web design isn't just about being "ugly." It's about being **honest**. 

## WHY NOW?

In a world of soft shadows and rounded corners, the sharp edge stands out. 

- **High Contrast**: Black and white, no gray areas.
- **Heavy Borders**: Define the space clearly.
- **Monospace Fonts**: The aesthetic of the machine.

### THE STACK

We are using Astro 5 to build this. It's fast. It's minimal. It's brutal.

```javascript
console.log("BRUTAL!");
```

Stay raw.
